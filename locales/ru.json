            "  1. Trading as mining. Each time you execute a trade (i.e. take an order off the order book), you get some VX. The amount of VX you receive will be calculated based on the proportion of the amount of trading fees that you paid to the total amount of trading fees collected by ViteX that day. \n",
            "  2. Referring as Mining. Every trader will get a referral code that they can share with their friends. When your friends sign up, they get 10% off of all trading fees on ViteX (Base Transaction Fee + any applicable Zone Fees), and an additional 2.5% mining rewards on trading. You benefit as 5% of your referred friends' accumulated trading fees get counted towards your daily accumulated trading fees.\n",
            "  3. Listing as Mining. List new trading pairs to mine VX. A user (“token issuer” or an “operator”) that lists a new trading pair will also receive VX. The token issuer’s reward is calculated as if he/she executed a trade involving a transaction fee of 1,000 VITE.\n",
            "  4. Staking as mining. The Vite public chain requires quota to properly allocate is computing resources. Quota is obtained by staking VITE. If you stake VITE to help ViteX obtain the quota it requires to run, then you get VX. \n",
            "  5. Market-making as Mining. Place orders to boost liquidity on ViteX and you’ll be rewarded with VX. "

          "  1. ViteX charges a Base Transaction Fee of 0.2% paid by all traders who use the ViteX platform. ",
          "  2. ViteX Operators running their own Zones may charge an additional fee (\"Operator Fee\") up to 0.2%. In other words, the minimum fees that a trader can pay is 0.2% (Base Transaction Fee with no Operator Fee) and the maximum is 0.4% (Base Transaction Fee + 0.2% Operator Fee). Operators also reserve the right to adjust their individual Operator Fees.",
          "The above fees are the same for both the makers and the takers.",

          "All the fees collected from the Base Transaction Fee charge will be re-distributed as dividends to VX holders.",
          "How do withdrawal fees work?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why release VX? Will it affect VITE? What is the relationship between VX and VITE?",
        "answer": [
          "VX can be understood as a “proof-of-equity” on the ViteX platform, which is a standalone application running on the Vite blockchain. ViteX has its own incentive model to encourage user trading. The value of VX is positively related to user and transaction volumes on ViteX. This will not affect the value of VITE, which is related to the Vite public chain. The value of VITE and the Vite chain increases as more dApps are run on Vite. VITE and VX are connected in some ways. For example, if VITE is staked to obtain certain quotas, VX can be earned. This means that resources on Vite can be used for transactions on ViteX."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a truly decentralized exchange and other exchanges?",
        "answer": [
          "At present, most decentralized exchanges are not truly decentralized as they are limited by the performance of their own public chain. Typically, transactions are performed off-chain and results are shown on-chain.",
          "ViteX is completely decentralized:",
          "  1. The transaction matching engine is performed through smart contracts that run on-chain",
          "  2. The order combinations are all completed on-chain",
          "  3. The order book is stored on-chain",
          "  4. The exchange fee redemption is implemented on-chain. Consequently, the results are fully public and dividend rules cannot be tampered with."

      },
      {
        "question": "The Vite chain has a transaction model without fees. Why does the Vite exchange charge a fee? Is the fee charged by VITE or other tokens?",
        "answer": "Transactions on the Vite chain do not consume gas like those on Ethereum, but another resource referred to as “quota.” Low-frequency traders can reach this quota by running a PoW on the local device. Since PoW takes time to complete, this mechanism is suitable for low-frequency usage. On the other hand, to accommodate high-frequency usage, traders will need to stake VITE in order to obtain the required quota. As a high frequency application, ViteX will also consume resources, which will be collected in the form of transaction fees on ViteX. Users can choose to stake VITE in order to fill quota on ViteX to lower the transaction fees. All collected transaction fees will be re-distributed to VX holders. The transaction fees will be paid out in “basic currencies” such as VITE, ETH, BTC and stablecoins. "

          "  2.  The number of VX mined decreases 0.5% daily in the first year. 477,032.36 VX will be released on the launch date of ViteX. 76,939.48 VX will be released one year after the launch. Thus, 80.095% of total supply will be released in the first year. The number of mined VX will decrease by 0.2% every day in the second year. 76,785.60 VX will be released on the first day of the second year and 37,050.73 VX will be released on the last day of the second year for a total of 100,000,000 VX."
