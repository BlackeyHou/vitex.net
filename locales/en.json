    "what": "What is VX?",
    "whatContent": "VX is the token associated with ViteX. VX holders enjoy payouts from a shared dividend pool comprised of transaction fees and listing fees. There will be no public nor private sale for VX. Users can only get VX through mining. The total supply of VX is 100 million. All VX will be distributed in two years, with zero inflation. The daily average VX distribution is 137,000. 10% of daily distributed VX will be set aside to fund future development of ViteX.",
    "how": "How do I get VX?",
    "howContent": "You can get VX in three ways. The first way is to trade on ViteX (“Trading is Mining”); the second way is to stake VITE and help ViteX receive quota for its operations (“Staking is Mining”); and the third way is to list trading pairs (“Listing is Mining”). Trading is Mining: 60% of daily released VX will be distributed to traders according to the proportion of their transaction fee on ViteX; Currently there will be four markets: BTC market, ETH market, VITE market and a stablecoin market. Each market will equally share 15% of the daily distribution. Staking is Mining: 30% of daily released VX will be distributed to users who participate in staking VITE for the benefit of ViteX. Listing is Mining: A user (“token issuer”) that lists a new trading pair will receive VX. As mentioned earlier, the token issuer receives VX by participating in the same pool as traders, with his/her share calculated as if he/she executed a trade involving a transaction fee of 1,000 VITE. A listing fee is required for the DEX: for a token issued on the Vite chain, the listing fee is 10,000 VITE. Otherwise, a cross-chain gateway will be involved in the listing and a related fee may be added. "

          "There are two categories that traders can choose from: 1. If traders want to be able to mine VX tokens, they will be subject to a fee rate of 4%. 2. If traders do not wish to mine VX tokens, they will be subject to a fee rate of 2.5%.\n",
          "The above fees are the same for both the makers and the takers.\n",
          "You can choose to stake 10,000 VITE to lower the trading fees to 3% and 1.5% (from 4% and 2.5%, respectively).\n",
          "All transaction fees collected will be re-distributed as dividends to VX holders.\n",

          "How do withdrawal fees work?\n",
          "There are no fees for deposits and withdrawals between the Vite wallet and ViteX; only quota will be consumed in these cases.\n",
          "When assets are withdrawn to non-Vite wallets, the partner cross-chain gateway, VGATE, will charge a withdrawal fee of 5%.\n"

        "question": "Why release VX? Will it affect VITE? What is the relationship between VX and VITE?",
        "answer": [
          "VX can be understood as a “proof-of-equity” on the ViteX platform, which is a standalone application running on the Vite blockchain. ViteX has its own incentive model to encourage user trading. The value of VX is positively related to user and transaction volumes on ViteX. This will not affect the value of VITE, which is related to the Vite public chain. The value of VITE and the Vite chain increases as more dApps are run on Vite. VITE and VX are connected in some ways. For example, if VITE is staked to obtain certain quotas, VX can be earned. This means that resources on Vite can be used for transactions on ViteX."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a truly decentralized exchange and other exchanges?",
        "answer": [
          "At present, most decentralized exchanges are not truly decentralized as they are limited by the performance of their own public chain. Typically, transactions are performed off-chain and results are shown on-chain.",
          "ViteX is completely decentralized: \n 1. The transaction matching engine is performed through smart contracts that run on-chain \n 2. The order combinations are all completed on-chain \n 3. The order book is stored on-chain \n 4. The exchange fee redemption is implemented on-chain. Consequently, the results are fully public and dividend rules cannot be tampered with."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "The Vite chain has a transaction model without fees. Why does the Vite exchange charge a fee? Is the fee charged by VITE or other tokens?",
        "answer": "Transactions on the Vite chain do not consume gas like those on Ethereum, but another resource referred to as “quota.” Low-frequency traders can reach this quota by running a PoW on the local device. Since PoW takes time to complete, this mechanism is suitable for low-frequency usage. On the other hand, to accommodate high-frequency usage, traders will need to stake VITE in order to obtain the required quota. As a high frequency application, ViteX will also consume resources, which will be collected in the form of transaction fees on ViteX. Users can choose to stake VITE in order to fill quota on ViteX to lower the transaction fees. All collected transaction fees will be re-distributed to VX holders. The transaction fees will be paid out in “basic currencies” such as VITE, ETH, BTC and stablecoins. "

          "1）联系社区网关，缴纳一定的铸币费用，链上铸币费用为燃烧1000 VITE或者抵押100,000VITE，生成自己的币种ABC；2）通过网关，交一定的网关服务费，开通ABC的跨链网关，允许用户将ABC从以太坊跨链转入Vite公链，即价值的映射；3）缴纳开通交易对的费用，花费10000 VITE开通ABC / ETH的交易对；也可以自己钱包开通更多的交易对。"
